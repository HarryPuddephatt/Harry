I think that in my first lesson on Marketing Persuasion went very well as I Learnt quite a few techniques on how to break down adverts to find out what the message they are trying to convey.

I also learnt various marketing techniques including pestering and media conceptions. 

Towards the beginning of the lesson I didn't really understand what Mr Keen was trying to show us, but as I listened on I understood more of the lesson. So overall i found this lesson to be very interesting.
